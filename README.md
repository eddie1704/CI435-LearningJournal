# CI435 HTML Learning Journal
This was my first University assignment for Ci435 Web Development. It is a running log of everything that I was taught in the lectures from the first semester. 
Features linked pages, images, styling (external CSS), form (demonstration only) and responsive layout. It is made out of HTML with CSS and has been tested with the W3C Validator.
